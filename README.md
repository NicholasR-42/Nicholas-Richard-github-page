Some of my important projects

go to https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/31949 to play the arcade game project without having to install greenfoot

to run the other projects, you will need to install a jdk. i recommend Bluej where you can download at https://www.bluej.org/. then extract the files and open them in bluej. after that you can right click the different files in bluej and run them.
